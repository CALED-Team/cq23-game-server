# Help


## Discord
We will provide you with any necessary help during the competition. If you have any questions, the first place to ask
them is our Discord server. You might even find the answer to your question 
there: [Discord Server](https://codequest.club/discord).

If you need assistance with something that can't be found/shared in the Discord server, you may email us

send emails asking for that sort of help. You may still post programming questions in Discord and maybe some other team
decides to give a hand. But we won't be able to do that, as it won't be fair to other participants.
