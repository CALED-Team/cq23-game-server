# Starting Your Code

You may use any programming language for your bots. The only requirement is being able to print in standard output and
read from standard input. However, if you choose to use Python, we have created a base template for you that you can use
to start your code faster.

## Python

In order to start a player off the Python template, open your terminal and go to a directory you want to create your bot
in and run this command:

```shell
cq23 new python <a name for your bot>
```

This will create a folder containing a starting code for your Python code. Open this folder in your code editor.

Refer to the `README.md` file in the created folder for more information about the template.

## All other languages

You may choose not to use any of the templates or maybe there are no templates for a language you want to use. In that
case, you can start your player by running this command:

```shell
cq23 new raw <a name for your bot>
```

This will create a folder for your player. Refer to the `README.md` file in the folder for more information about how you
can develop your player from there.
